These models, such as GPT-4, BERT, and LLaMA, use deep learning techniques, specifically transformers, to process and predict text with high accuracy. LLMs can perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. They learn the meaning of words and sentences by analyzing language patterns, making them useful for chatbots, content creation, and decision-making applications. However, they require significant computational power and careful handling to ensure ethical and unbiased outputs.\n"
